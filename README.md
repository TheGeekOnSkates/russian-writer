# Russian Writer 2.0

## Intro and instructions

I've been learning Russian on duolingo.com (I have the app but prefer the website) and needed a way to easily write Russian characters.  This program turns an English keyboard into a Russian keyboard and back again.  To use it:
1. Clone or download the repo.  The program is pre-compiled in the "Release" folder (russian-writer.exe).
2. Run the program and Bingo!  Your keyboard will write in Russian.
3. To turn Russian Mode on or off, press SHIFT+CTRL+R.

## Contributing
I'm totally open to suggestions, if you want to contribute to this project.  Some ideas might include:
* Building support for other platforms (I'm pretty much a Windows guy; I dabble in Linux but don't know its APIs well enough to do that)
* Changes to make it more like an actual Russian keyboard (I've never actually seen one)
* Writers for other languages!  This was originally Spanish Writer (which I still use every once in awhile) but those are the only languages I know.
* And I know C (obviously) but I'm far from an expert; I would really be interested in ways to simplify it, optimize it, or whatever else would help.

## License

The code relies heavily on the Windows (a.k.a. Win32) API, so it probably has to be under the Microsoft Public License (MS-PL).  I'm not a lawyer, and I'm not gonna pretend to know what I'm talking about in this area, but if I were pressed for an answer I'd go with MS-PL (well personally I'd go with WTFL but that probably can't be used here). :)
